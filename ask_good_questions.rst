Asking Good Questions in #python
================================

Prep Work
---------

Know What You are Trying
************************

The first response to many questions in #python is often "What are you trying
to do?".  The person answering your question is trying to understand the
problem.  All to many times a new user will ask a question about why their
implementation of something does not work, and when asking for help, focus only
on a small part of the implementation that is breaking.

In order to help solve your problems, those answering questions need to
understand the problem your code is trying to solve.  That is often more
important than the details of the code you have already written.

Identify Your Problem
*********************

You should have a full understanding of the problem you are having.  This
sounds kind of odd at first.  It is obvious that you are having a problem with
some aspect of your application, and you likely do not understand why; after
all, if you did, you probably would not be asking the question in the first
place.  What you have to understand is what your code is actually doing, and
where it is breaking.

This is the counterpoint to the previous section;  This is all about
implementation detail.

Think About your Question
*************************

It is a good practice to write your question out in a word processor or text
editor before asking it in channel.  This gives you the opportunity to check if
the question makes sense, and if you have provided enough information to a
potential helper to get you an answer.

Try it And See
**************

Before you ask a question if some operation is possible, try it yourself.
Write a small python module that demonstrates what you are trying, and run it.
If it runs, then you have your answer without asking.  If it does not run, or
does not run correctly, you have a basis from which to ask your question (this
should only be invoked if you are unable to share your code, see bellow.)

Show Your Code
**************

It saves a lot of time and energy to have a web-paste or a link to a hosted
version control site ready when you are asking a question.  This allows the
helpers to see the actual code that is causing an issue, and they may be able
to find an apparently unrelated piece of code that is the root cause of your
problem.  They can also make suggestions about the structure of your
application to help you find a better way of doing something.

If you cannot share your code for some reason, you should have, previously
prepared, a module with everything in it required to show the problem you are
having.  This is what you should provide in a web-paste if you cannot show your
actual code.  Keep in mind, that this is no substitute to showing your actual
code.

Asking Your Question
--------------------

Do's and Don't's
****************

Do
  - Have your reasonably well worded question ready
  - Have a link to your code ready

Don't
  - Ask if anyone is around the answer questions
  - Ask if someone knows the library you are having trouble with
