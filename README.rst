Contributing
************

This project is following the GitHub standard workflow.  To contribute, fork
the repository, make your changes in a new branch, and send me a pull request.
The development branch is 'draft', fork your branch from it, not 'master'.

I am actively seeking more things to put into the Python FAQ.  If you are not
in the mood to write a prose section on a problem, please file an issue with
the question and solution.
